# SteamIconGetter
Steam under linux does an awful job of getting icons for most games. I found a script that creats an openbox pipe menu and populates it with all your downloaded games. With a slight modification I added icon support for the games.

This is a simple steam Icon grabber to go with the companion script, it will check what games you have downloaded, then use the web API to check your profile and grab the 32x32 pixel icons for each game and place them in the appropriate directory.

You will to enter your Steam 64 ID and also get your own Web API Key and enter it as well. 

Your end result should look something like this:
